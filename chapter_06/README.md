# Chapter 06 - Zero to Few Shot Prompting

In this chapter we explore the idea of turning a language model into a classifier using the techniques
of zero and few shot prompting. These examples will require access to proprietary LLM vendors APIs.

You should be able to easily switch between vendors by changing the library used to import and initiate the model.

**NOTE:** All code examples assume you have your API set up in your environment variables.
